# Progress Tracking & Image Upload Guide

## ✅ Progress Tracking Implementation

### How Progress is Saved

Student progress is automatically tracked and saved throughout the course at multiple levels:

#### 1. **Automatic Lesson Access Tracking**
- When a student navigates to any lesson, their access is automatically recorded
- Current lesson position is saved in MongoDB
- Last accessed timestamp is updated

#### 2. **Interactive Element Progress**
- **Poll Responses**: Saved to browser localStorage
  - Persists even after page refresh
  - Shows previously selected answer
- **Design Fixer**: Progress tracked in real-time
  - Found hotspots remembered during session
- **Reflection Prompts**: Responses can be typed and saved

#### 3. **Lesson Completion**
- Manual completion via "Mark as Complete" button
- Automatic completion when quiz is passed
- Completion status synced to MongoDB
- Progress bar updates in real-time

#### 4. **Quiz Scores**
- Quiz attempts and scores saved to database
- Best score tracked per lesson
- Completion percentage calculated automatically

### Progress Data Structure

```typescript
{
  userId: "user123",
  courseId: "course456",
  moduleProgress: [
    {
      moduleId: "module1",
      currentLesson: 2,
      completedLessons: [0, 1],
      lessons: [
        {
          lessonIndex: 0,
          completed: true,
          lastAccessedAt: "2025-01-24T08:00:00Z",
          quizScore: 85,
          quizAttempts: 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  overallProgress: 45,
  lastAccessedAt: "2025-01-24T08:30:00Z"
}
```

### Where Progress is Stored

1. **MongoDB** (Server-side)
   - Lesson completion status
   - Quiz scores and attempts
   - Current lesson position
   - Overall course progress percentage

2. **LocalStorage** (Client-side)
   - Poll responses
   - Interactive element states
   - Temporary session data

### How to View Student Progress

**As Admin:**
1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
2. View user progress reports
3. See completion rates per module

**As Student:**
1. Progress bar shows on each lesson page
2. Completed lessons marked with ✓
3. Overall progress visible on course page

Images are stored in the interactive element data:
```json
{
  "type": "designFixer",
  "badSlideUrl": "https://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/design-fixer/123_bad.png",
  "goodSlideUrl": "https://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/design-fixer/123_good.png",
  "hotspots": [...]
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Progress Not Saving

**Issue**: Lesson completion not persisting

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify user is logged in (check token)
3. Check MongoDB connection
4. Verify Progress model exists in database

**Issue**: Poll response not saving

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser localStorage (DevTools → Application → Local Storage)
2. Clear localStorage and try again
3. Check for JavaScript errors in console

### Image Upload Issues

**Issue**: Upload button not visible

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you're logged in as admin (`role: "admin"`)
2. Check user object in AuthContext
3. Log out and log back in

**Issue**: Image upload fails

**Solutions**:
1. **File too large** → Compress image (max 10MB)
2. **AWS credentials missing** → Check `.env` file
3. **CORS error** → Check S3 bucket CORS settings
4. **Network error** → Check internet connection

**Issue**: Image doesn't display after upload

**Solutions**:
1. Check S3 bucket permissions (public read)
2. Verify URL in database is correct
3. Check browser console for 403/404 errors
4. Clear browser cache
