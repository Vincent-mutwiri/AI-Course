# Production Build Fix: Interactive Elements

## Problem
Interactive elements (simulations) loaded correctly in development but failed in production despite using the same MongoDB URL.

## Root Cause
The issue was **NOT** with MongoDB or the database connection. The problem was with how JSON data files were being imported in the React components.

In development, Vite's dev server handles JSON imports dynamically. However, in production builds, JSON imports can sometimes fail to bundle correctly, especially when using path aliases (`@/data/...`).

## Solution
Moved all JSON data from external files into inline TypeScript constants within the components.

### Files Modified

1. **vite.config.ts** - Added JSON handling configuration
2. **SentenceBuilder.tsx** - Inlined prediction model data
3. **PresentationCoach.tsx** - Inlined coach configuration data
4. **DataDashboard.tsx** - Inlined school analytics data
5. **ConceptMap.tsx** - Inlined concept map nodes and edges

## Changes Made

### Before (External JSON Import)
```typescript
import predictionData from '@/data/simulations/sentenceBuilder.json';
const model = predictionData.predictionModel;
```

### After (Inline Data)
```typescript
const predictionModel: Record<string, string[]> = {
  "Artificial": ["intelligence", "life", "neural", "systems", "networks"],
  // ... rest of data
};
const model = predictionModel;
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Guaranteed Production Compatibility** - No build-time JSON import issues
2. **Better Tree Shaking** - Unused data can be eliminated by bundler
3. **Faster Load Times** - No separate JSON file requests
4. **Type Safety** - Direct TypeScript typing without assertions
5. **Simpler Deployment** - Fewer files to manage

## Testing

After deploying these changes:

1. Build the production bundle: `npm run build`
2. Preview locally: `npm run preview`
3. Test all interactive elements:
   - Visual Tokens
   - Sentence Builder
   - Presentation Coach
   - Data Dashboard
   - Concept Map

All should now work identically in both development and production.

## Note on JSON Files

The original JSON files in `src/data/simulations/` can be kept for reference or removed. They are no longer imported by any components.

## Deployment Steps

```bash
# 1. Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: inline JSON data to resolve production build issues"

# 2. Push to production
git push origin main

# 3. Rebuild on your hosting platform (Render, Vercel, etc.)
# The platform will automatically detect the changes and rebuild
```

## Alternative Solutions (Not Used)

We chose inline data, but other options included:
- Moving JSON to `public/` folder and fetching via HTTP
- Using dynamic imports with proper error handling
- Creating a separate data module with explicit exports

The inline approach was chosen for its simplicity and reliability.
